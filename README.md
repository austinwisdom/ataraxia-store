No need to download or install anything in order to see the app, simply navigate to ataraxia.tokyo and enjoy. Make sure to press play and scroll to the right to see the story unfold.

## $\textcolor{magenta}{\textsf{Phase I}}$

Phase I is the design and deployment of the landing page. Each image was generated by DALL-e 2, OpenAI's image-generating AI model, and fit the Synthwave aesthetic of the app.

## $\textcolor{magenta}{\textsf{Phase II}}$

Phase II (currently in progress) involves an elaborate image gallery, and a products page where visitors can purchase uniquely designed apparel fitting the theme and story of the app.
